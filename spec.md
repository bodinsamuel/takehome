# Takehome Task Specification

Your task is to implement a REST API which:

1. Has two endpoints `/encrypt` and `/decrypt`. Each endpoint should take
a JSON payload.
2. The server's key(s) should be generated on first start and written to
disk, and should be read in on subsequent startups.
3. Use the key from step 2 to implement encryption and decryption on the
`/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints respectively.
   - `/encrypt` should encrypt every value in the object (at a depth of 1), returning the encrypted payload as JSON.
   - `/decrypt` should detect encrypted strings and decrypt them, returning the decrypted payload as JSON.

   For example:

   ```JSON
   {
     "foo": "foobar",
     "bar": {
       "isBar": true
     }
   }
   ```

   would become

   ```JSON
   {
     "foo": "some_encrypted_string",
     "bar": "some_encrypted_string"
   }
   ```

4. Create a `/sign` endpoint which takes a JSON payload and computes a
cryptographic signature for the plaintext payload. The signature is then
sent in a JSON response.
5. Create a `/verify` endpoint, which takes a JSON payload of the form

```js
{
   "signature": "<COMPUTED_SIGNATURE>",
   "data": {
      // ...
   }
}
```

- Data can be any JSON object and can contain encrypted fields.
- Any encrypted fields in the data should be decrypted before
computing its signature is recomputed. If this signature matches the
given signature, the response should be `204`, else `400`.
